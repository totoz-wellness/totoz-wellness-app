**Frontend Structure & Organization â€“ Suggestion**

Hey team,

Here's a proposed structure and setup suggestion for our frontend. The goal is to make the project easier to scale, maintain, and collaborate on as we add more features (like admin pages, guides, Q&A, etc.). This isn't a strict change â€” just a shared standard to keep our code organized and future-proof.

ðŸ—‚ **Proposed Folder Structure**

src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common/         # Shared UI components (Header, Footer, etc.)
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/           # Login, Signup, AuthModal, etc.
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home/           # Homepage sections (Hero, Features, CTA, etc.)
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Home.tsx
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Login.tsx
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Signup.tsx
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Admin/
  â”‚   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard.tsx
  â”‚   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ ManageGuides.tsx
  â”‚   â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ ManageDirectory.tsx
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AppRoutes.tsx   # All route definitions
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ services/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api.ts          # Axios or fetch configuration for backend calls
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ context/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AuthContext.tsx # Manages global authentication state
  â”‚
  â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.tsx
  â”œâ”€â”€ index.css

 **Why This Matters**

- **Scalability**: We'll be adding multiple pages soon (Admin, Q&A, Guides, Directory). A structured layout prevents confusion.
- **Clarity**: Each file's purpose becomes clear â€” no more "everything inside App.tsx."
- **Team Collaboration**: Easier for everyone to find and update specific parts.
- **Future Features**: Adding routing and protected pages becomes smooth.

 **Example of Clean App.tsx**
```jsx
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import AppRoutes from "./routes/AppRoutes";
import Header from "./components/common/Header";
import Footer from "./components/common/Footer";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Header />
      <AppRoutes />
      <Footer />
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

This keeps App.tsx simple â€” only layout and routing logic live here.

 #### Notes

Components like Hero, Features, etc., can stay the same, just moved under /home/ for clarity.
This structure works perfectly with React Router, Context API, and future backend integration.
Weâ€™ll keep improving together â€” this is just a foundation we can all build on.

#### Goal
Keep it clean, collaborative, and easy for everyone to continue from any point.
